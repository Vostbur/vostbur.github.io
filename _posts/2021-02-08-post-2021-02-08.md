I tried to write a simple web app with backend on Django REST framework and frontend with React. My choice for setting up a Django project with React is to load a single HTML template and let React manage the frontend. I keep React closer to Django. Django REST as a standalone API with React as a standalone SPA might be a more correct way, but more complex.
