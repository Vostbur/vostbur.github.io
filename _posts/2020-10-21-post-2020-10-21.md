I finished solving the problems from Chapter 3 of the book “Cracking the Coding Interview. 6th Edition”. Solutions for Go and Python are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vostbur/cracking-the-coding-interview-6th) as before.

The next Chapter is focused to algorithms of graphs. I do not know if there will be more complex tasks. At first sight, this will be the most interesting experience. And I don't think I'll do all the tasks soon.
