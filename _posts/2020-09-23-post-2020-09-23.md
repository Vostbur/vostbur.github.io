Do you need to mix traffic between different VLANs without any limits and configuration settings?
The best way is to inject a hub between access ports on switch and customers.

This is actually a joke. But, unfortunately, this is possible, and there is no way to hope for the STP.
The first thing that should alert you is the repeated messages _"%CDP-4-NATIVE_VLAN_MISMATCH: Native VLAN mismatch discovered on..."_ if CDP is enabled. A hundred percent confirmation is the duplication of mac addresses for all VLAN interfaces.

It will be necessary to write a script for automation detection such loops.

By the way, for a while you are searching problem it will be useful disable CDP.

command for global disable CDP: `no cdp run`

command for disable CDP for the current interface (in interface configuration mode): `no cdp enable`

### Useful Cisco command

Starting from IOS 15.1 cisco command `history` is appeared. It outputs a pretty nice ASCII diagram of interfaces loading.

For enable:

```
(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
(config-if)# history bps
```

Now you can see the result using the command:

```
# show interface GigabitEthernet 0/1 history 60sec input
```

The different periods (60sec, 60min, 72hour) and different traffic directions (input, output, both) are available.
