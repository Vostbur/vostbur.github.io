I tried the facial recognition library for Python [ageitgey/face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition).

This library uses dlib, a toolkit written in C++ that contains machine learning algorithms. For example, I'm trying to check if an actor is playing in the TV series "The Big Bang Theory". A test image with an actor is compared to real actors filmed in a TV show.

The working solution is packaged in a docker container.
