### Coding

Started the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Vostbur/cracking-the-coding-interview-6th) with solutions for ["Cracking the Coding Interview. 6th Edition"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) the amazing book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. So far, there are solutions only for the Chapter 1.

### English

A few words about my attempts to learn English.

Every day I try to watch videos in English. Since March, it has been the TV series "The Office". And so I finished all 9 seasons. The next show on my agenda is "How I met your mother". Both of them are the best TV series for learning modern spoken English in my opinion. On the one hand, there are a lot of conversations with informal phrases, and on the other - not so much jargon related to cultural characteristics.

Another useful material that helps me with spoken English is the book ["Инглиш на ладошке с @naladoshke"](https://www.chitai-gorod.ru/catalog/book/1262343/). Only from this book I found out the real meaning of some of the phrases that I used to translate literally.
