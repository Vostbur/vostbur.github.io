This time I'm posting some links to useful resources.

- As I deep into front-end development I come across a lot of new information about cutting-edge technologies. It's amazing to have opportunities to use ones. First of all, I would keep up with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Sockets](https://socket.io/).


- Some links for web-design

    https://ant.design/ - Ant design, alternative for Bootstrap

    https://loading.io/ - awesome animated loaders

    https://fontawesome.com/ - icon library

    https://themeforest.net/ - WordPress Themes & Website Templates

- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - a Python library to read/write Excel 2010. It works with xlsx/xlsm files only but does it well.
  
- Improve your programming skills

    https://leetcode.com/

    https://www.hackerrank.com/

- Other useful links

    https://regex101.com/ - Regular expressions constructor

    https://leanpub.com/ - A library where you can pay for books as much as you want

- [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) - a nodejs app that turns a website into an application that can be run on the desktop.

    Install:
    
    `# npm install nativefier -g`

    Run:

    `nativefier --name "Habrahabr" "https://habr.com/ru/"`
