title: The framework for Django production-ready projects boilerplating
---

From the blog post ["How to Dockerize Django in 5 minutes"](https://justdjango.com/blog/django-docker-tutorial) I found out about a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). Cookiecutter is a CLI utility for creating an application boilerplate from a template. It uses the *Jinja2* template system to replace or customize folder and file names, as well as the contents of files. 

Especially useful to me is [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Cookiecutter Django creates a ready-made boilerplate for deploying a Django application in a docker container with all the necessary configuration files. The article is just about this.
