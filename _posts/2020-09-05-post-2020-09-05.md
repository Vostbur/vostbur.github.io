I recently wrote a Python script to log changes in the selected folder.
The script has a GUI based on Tkinter, the native Python library.

I decide to rewrite this script in the Golang.
I only need one executable file that doesn't require Python installation.
Before that, I made an executable file using *pyinstaller*.
But why not try Golang?

Apart from Tkinter, I only know a little about the GTK. I used it for a new version of the program written in Golang with a GUI.

It wasn't the best option.
Running on Windows requires about 30 MB of multiple dll files along with the executable file.
I couldn't compile a program with a static linked graphics library.
Even [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63712966/how-do-i-make-a-portable-executable-application-on-golang-with-the-gtk3-gui) didn't help me.

As a result, I wrote a program.

But I will be looking for alternative libraries that will help me write a simple GUI program on Windows that doesn't require additional dependencies.
