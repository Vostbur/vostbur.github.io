I have almost finished solving the problems in chapter 4 of the book "Cracking the Coding Interview. 6th Edition".
Only problem 4.7 is remained. It is the hardest thing for me.
Although when solving other problems in section 4, I had to peek at the solutions.

My immediate goal is to learn frontend devepoment.
I spent a long time choosing which framework or library to study in depth.
The choice was between Angular, Reactos, and VueJS.

I got the impression that Angular is a powerful framework for large projects created by large teams.
I've liked the VueJS.
This framework allows you to quickly and easily create small single-page applications.

But I chose ReactJS.
This library is quite simple and exists a lot of manuals and video tutorials.
One of the best for beginners is course ["ReactJS путь самурая"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8) (on Russian).
