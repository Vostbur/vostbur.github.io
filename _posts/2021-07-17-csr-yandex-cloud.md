title: Setup Cisco CSR1000V in Yandex.Cloud
---

In Yandex.Cloud, you can deploy a Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v virtual router from a ready-made virtual machine image.

There is an awesome manual at this [link](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/solutions/routing/cisco) to Yandex docs.

For my experiments, I ran two instances of CSR1000v. I have configured a connection to one of them using SSH. Both of them are interconnected by a local network.

This is one of the possible ways to study the training courses of the Cisco Network Academy.
