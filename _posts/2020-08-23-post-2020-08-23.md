This day is inspired by the article ["Визуализация сетевых топологий, или зачем еще сетевому инженеру Python #2"](https://habr.com/ru/post/501164/). I wrote [Golang program](https://github.com/Vostbur/macnetmap) that analyzes the output of the cisco *sh int*, *sh mac-address-table* (for switches) or *sh ip arp* (for routers) commands and vizualizes network topology from mac address tables. I only used mac address information, not LLDP (CDP). This is probably the next step.

[NeXt Ui](https://developer.cisco.com/site/neXt/) ([Github](https://github.com/NeXt-UI/next-bower)) is used for visualization.

For example, I received an output with self-made [telnet client on Golang](https://github.com/Vostbur/telgo) from a network of this topology:

As result, you can see a clickable diagram in the browser with devices and links between them:
