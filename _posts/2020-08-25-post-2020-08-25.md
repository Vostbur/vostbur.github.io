I wrote a program that visualizes the network topology based on CDP. Previously, I made topology a network of switches, for which is quite enough data about the neighbor's mac-addresses. If routers appear in the network, then you can't do without LLDP(CDP). The code is still raw, and it took a little more than two hours to write it. The main goal is to practice in Golang.

The source code, sample CDP data, and the result of computing on this data is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vostbur/cdptopology). I built the topology of this network:

The main headache of today is installing and running the latest version of Ubuntu Lts in a VMware. Since Ubuntu version 18.04 (maybe from 17.10), there are no */etc/network/interfaces* and *net-tools* with the usual *ifconfig* and *route* commands. They were replaced by *netplan* and *iproute2*.

Now this is what network configuration looks like:

```
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ ip -c addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens33: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:28:ef:9a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.15.129/24 brd 192.168.15.255 scope global dynamic ens33
       valid_lft 1575sec preferred_lft 1575sec
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe28:ef9a/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ ls /etc/netplan
00-installer-config.yaml
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: true
      addresses: []
      optional: true
  version: 2
```

In this case the ip-address is received from dhcp.
For now to set the ip-address, you need to write something like:

`ip addr add 192.168.0.77/24 broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev eth0` 

for to make changes available after a reboot, edit the yaml file in the */etc/netplan* directory and apply the changes with the command

`sudo netplan apply`

By the way you can test changes before committing with the command

`sudo netplay try`

in this case, the system will wait for 2 minutes for confirmation, and then return the old settings. It is useful for configure remote servers.
I'm not used to the new `ip something` commands yet and use the tips from the article ["Тяжелое расставание с Net-Tools"](https://habr.com/ru/post/320278/).
