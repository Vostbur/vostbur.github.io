### Some links to my [gist](https://gist.github.com/Vostbur)

I read several articles about neural networks and then wrote a simple [single-layer perceptron](https://gist.github.com/Vostbur/1c81355af53e7a715dd0857c402cf1ca) on Golang. I haven't used any external libraries for Golang and don't even know if they exist. Maybe it's time to find out. This theme is very popular recently and interesting for me.

There is also a small [script](https://gist.github.com/Vostbur/9e514d2c8c07e3aed1b7a87718b9d393) that demonstrates how to sort an array of positive numbers without sorting. This is a fun case of using goroutines.
