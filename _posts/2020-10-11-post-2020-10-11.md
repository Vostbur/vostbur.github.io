Added solutions for Chapter 2 of the book "Cracking the Coding Interview. 6th Edition" for both Python and Go. [Link](https://github.com/Vostbur/cracking-the-coding-interview-6th) to the GitHub repository.

The second chapter of the book is about linked lists. I don't make a living by working as programmer. It was interesting to recall this data structure for two reasons. First af all, there are native implementations or libraries for linked lists in popular programming languages. Second, beside the fact that linked list are rarely used on their own, I haven't made my own implementation of a linked list in more than twenty years since my school years.

By the way, you can find solutions in more then fifteen languages following on the [link](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition).

P.S. I added comments to this site based on GitHub pages. The comment service is provide by Disqus. Welcome if you have something to say.
