I wrote a traditional application for such kind of training cases in React. This is a simple to-do list.

In my app, I don't use any extensions for state management. Only clean React with state saving in local storage. I spied the main ideas on the Udemy course ["React + Redux. Professional development"](https://www.udemy.com/course/pro-react-redux/). But mostly I tried to write the code myself. I would like to dive into React Native a bit and migrate this app to Android. But it depends on the availability of free time.
