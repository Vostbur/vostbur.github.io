title: My experience of learning Django courses
---

It's time to share my experience of learning Django courses on Udemy with someone.

The best course for beginners is ["Django 3-A complete stack of web sites with Python web development"](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-3-make-websites-with-python-tutorial-beginner-learn-bootstrap/). In addition to Django, there is an introduction to Python in course. Three projects are dedicated to Django with functional views and Django templates. This course is also translated into Russian as ["Django 3 - Full Stack разработка веб-сайтов на Python"](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-3-full-stack-python/).

The next most useful course is ["React & Django Full Stack: web app, backend API, mobile Apps"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-full-stack/). This course features class views, a Django Rest Framework with an frontend with ReactJS, and React Native for mobile apps.

I also want to recommend three books by [William S. Vincent](https://leanpub.com/u/wsvincent) for noobs, professionals, and about the API with DRF, respectively.

These courses with books by William S. Vincent are the best approach to dive in Django.
