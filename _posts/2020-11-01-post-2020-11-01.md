title: Debian in VMware Workstation Player
---

For the needs of pet projects, I installed Debian in the VMware Workstation Player running on Windows.
First of all, I met some common problems. I write here the steps to solve them.

### 1. 'Username' is not in the sudoers file.

```
$ su -
# visudo
```

add row
```
'Username'    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

where 'Username' is your username and save

### 2. The graphics environment does not support the screen resolution you need.

Command to display the supported resolutions and name of your video output.

```
$ xandr
```

Generate line for new resolution

```
$ cvt 1920 1080 60
```

Output

```
Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
```

I wrote a file *Display.sh* and make it executable. I've put a link to this file on the desktop and run it if I need to change the resolution.

```
#!/bin/sh
xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
xrandr --addmode Virtual1 1920x1080_60.00
xrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00
```

*Virtual1* is a name of your video output from *xandr* output.

### 3. The sound is muted

The PulseAudio mixer is set to zero by default. Just move adjustment to 100%
