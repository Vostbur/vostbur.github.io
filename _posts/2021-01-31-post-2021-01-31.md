I wrote a web service that uses python [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library for face recognition from image and compares the recognized face with the data stored in the database.

Information can be sent to the server via a POST request or a web form. The server returns the status 200 OK with the name of the person in JSON found by the photo in the database or the status 404 NOT FOUND.

The web service is written with Django. PostgreSQL is used as the database. Gunicorn is used as the application server. Nginx is used as a proxy server for sending static files.

For rapid deployment on the server, I wrote a docker-compose configuration file. For development and production, I made different docker-compose configuration files. The entire project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vostbur/py-facial-recognition).

For testing, I deployed the service on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). I used a droplet with Ubuntu 20.04. Docker and docker-compose installed on the server according to the instructions on the link [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). To build the project, you need at least 2GB of RAM.
