title: First acquaintance with EVE-NG
---

I got acquainted with the emulated vitrual environment EVE-NG. The image with EVE for VMware (OVF version) and all the necessary utilities can be downloaded from the official website [eve-ng.net](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/download/). Images of devices are easy to find with Google or on the official websites of manufacturers. For example, for [mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/download).

You can add your own images in this way (for example, Cisco router and switch images and the windows client side for EVE-NG):

We connect via WinSCP to EVE virtual machine. Next, go to the directory `/opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/`.

There we create two folders with the name:

`viosl2-15` is for L2 image 15 version

`vios-15` is for L3 image version 15

The QEMU images inside the folders should be called `virtioa.qcow2`.

After that, we go over ssh to EVE virtual machine and enter the command

`/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions`

in order for the system to see added images.

Now you can go to the EVE-NG web interface and select the cisco router and switch in the nodes.

For testing, I made a laboratory for setting up the GRE tunnel.
