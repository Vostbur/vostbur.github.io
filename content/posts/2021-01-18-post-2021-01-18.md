title: Facial recognition with Python
---

I tried the facial recognition library for Python [ageitgey/face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition).

This library uses dlib, a toolkit written in C++ that contains machine learning algorithms. For example, I'm trying to check if an actor is playing in the TV series "The Big Bang Theory". A test image with an actor is compared to real actors filmed in a TV show.

I wrote a web service that uses python **face_recognition** library for face recognition from image and compares the recognized face with the data stored in the database.

Information can be sent to the server via a POST request or a web form. The server returns the status **200 OK** with the name of the person in JSON found by the photo in the database or the status **404 NOT FOUND**.

The web service is written with Django. PostgreSQL is used as the database. Gunicorn is used as the application server. Nginx is used as a proxy server for sending static files.

The working solution is packaged in a docker container. For rapid deployment on the server, I wrote a docker-compose configuration file. For development and production, I made different docker-compose configuration files. The entire project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vostbur/py-facial-recognition).

For testing, I deployed the service on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). I used a droplet with Ubuntu 20.04. Docker and docker-compose installed on the server according to the instructions on the link [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). To build the project, you need at least 2GB of RAM.
