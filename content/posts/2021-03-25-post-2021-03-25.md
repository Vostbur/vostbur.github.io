title: Django project deployed on Heroku

About a year ago, I published a web-based task management application written with Flask. It looked like this:

Since a year has passed, I decided to rewrite this project in Django, and also try to deploy it to PaaS Heroku. I've also made some improvements, including design, authorization, database management, and web security issues. That's what happened:
