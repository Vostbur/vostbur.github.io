In [mapquest.com](https://developer.mapquest.com/) I have found out the best APIs for working with maps and geopositions in my opinion.

For example, I wrote a small [script](https://gist.github.com/Vostbur/4bceb711891bae56ddfbeb0d59a2d291) to navigate between cities. That is the result for the route from Bryansk to Moscow.

The API has many request [parameters](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/directions-api/route/get/). JSON response contains a lot of data:
