title: How to live without net-tools
---

The main headache of today is installing and running the latest version of Ubuntu Lts in a VMware. Since Ubuntu version 18.04 (maybe from 17.10), there are no */etc/network/interfaces* and *net-tools* with the usual *ifconfig* and *route* commands. They were replaced by *netplan* and *iproute2*.

Now this is what network configuration looks like:

```
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ ip -c addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens33: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:28:ef:9a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.15.129/24 brd 192.168.15.255 scope global dynamic ens33
       valid_lft 1575sec preferred_lft 1575sec
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe28:ef9a/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ ls /etc/netplan
00-installer-config.yaml
alex@ubuntu-server-lts:~$ cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: true
      addresses: []
      optional: true
  version: 2
```

In this case the ip-address is received from dhcp.
For now to set the ip-address, you need to write something like:

`ip addr add 192.168.0.77/24 broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev eth0` 

for to make changes available after a reboot, edit the yaml file in the */etc/netplan* directory and apply the changes with the command

`sudo netplan apply`

By the way you can test changes before committing with the command

`sudo netplay try`

in this case, the system will wait for 2 minutes for confirmation, and then return the old settings. It is useful for configure remote servers.
I'm not used to the new `ip something` commands yet and use the tips from the article ["Тяжелое расставание с Net-Tools"](https://habr.com/ru/post/320278/).
